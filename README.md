Ontologies for DM2E's interoperability platform
===============================================

All of them are in `src/main/resources` so they are available in the Java classpath as resources

*import-xturtle* Imports from https://github.com/AKSW/Xturtle/tree/develop/vocabularies
*stubs* Stubs for ontologies that should be replace later on with the real ontologies
*dm2e-edm* DM2E Domain Model (formerly `EDM+`) and EDM turtle versions
*dm2e-omnom* Ontologies specific to the DM2E ingestion platform (Web Services, File Types)
